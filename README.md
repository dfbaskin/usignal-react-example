# React and µsignal Example

An example of using React with [µsignal](https://github.com/WebReflection/usignal) signals library.

It uses a React context to pass a set of signals down to child components.  The context does not change after being initialized. A hook is provided to retrieve signals from the context, which also subscribes to signal changes and automatically re-renders the components.
